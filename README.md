## Development setup

1. Clone the repository on your machine.
2. Create a Python virtual environment in the project directory, and be sure to activate it so nothing gets installed globally.
3. Run ``pip install .`` to install all the dependencies from ``pyproject.toml``.
4. Substitute your OpenAI API key (if you have one) in ``.env.sample`` and rename that file to ``.env``.
5. Start coding! Be aware of the pricing for OpenAI API access when you run the program.
