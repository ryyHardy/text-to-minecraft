# Text-To-Minecraft

> A bot to help you with all your Minecraft-related needs!

TextToMinecraft is a bot that uses AI to build structures for you in-game based on your prompt! It is also equipped with other features like some basic pathfinding and the ability to execute in-game commands.

> ### WARNING
>
> This project is still very much a work-in-progress, so use with caution if you plan on testing it in a Minecraft world. The bot can build some really cool things, but it could destroy preexisting landscapes and buildings in the process.
